<p>The code is explained on Rpubs: http://rpubs.com/Grebbel/269250 </p>
<p>The antibiogram_raw part.txt contains part of the raw data for the analysis. </p>
<p>The antibiogram.r file reads the raw date, cleans it up and fits the data into usuable dataframes. </p>
<p> Bacteria resis2.r is a collection of all kinds of analyses. a bit messy </p>
<p>Bacteria group is merging the Bacteria species into groups. A newDF3 is made which is further used for other analyses </p>
<p> Bacteria source: looking at the specimen sources seperately </p>
